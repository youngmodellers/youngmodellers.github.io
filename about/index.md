<p>We, the <font color="#4eb14e"><b>"Young Modellers in Ecology" (YoMos)</b></font>, are a group of young scientists working in all fields of ecological modelling. We first came together in 2005, highly motivated by the idea to improve scientific exchange on the level of master and PhD students. Since 2011, the YoMos are an official specialist group ("Arbeitskreis") of the Ecological Society of Germany, Austria and Switzerland <a href="http://www.gfoe.org/">(Gf√ñ)</a>. Over the past years, the YoMos have become a broad international network for young scientists.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the YoMos are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>to offer a networking-platform for young ecological modellers</li>
	<li>to exchange experiences on all aspects of ecological modelling and thus help young researchers at the start of their scientific career</li>
	<li>to notify members of upcoming job positions in the field of ecological modeling via regular e-mails</li>
</ul>
