We convene a session [“Are we any good at simulating ecology? Success and future challenges in ecological simulation models“](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/events/annual-meeting-2017/thematic-topic-ghent-2017/) at this year’s Joint Annual Meeting of the British Ecological Society (BES), NecoV and Gesellschaft für Ökologie (GfOe), in association with the European Ecological Federation (EEF), between 11<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> December 2017 in Ghent, Belgium. This session is organized and chaired together with the GfOe working group ["Computational Ecology"](https://akcomputationalecology.wordpress.com/) and the BES working group ["Quantitative Ecology"](https://besquantitativeecology.wordpress.com/) and is going to take place on **Thursday, 14<sup>th</sup> December 2017, 9:45 a.m.**. We are looking forward to exciting talks of our invited speakers:

+ Dries Bonte (University of Ghent)
+ Mike Harfoot (UNEP-WCMC Cambridge)
+ Sonia Kefi (CNRS Grenoble)
+ David Orme (Imperial College London)
+ Laura Pollock (CNRS Grenoble)
+ Damaris Zurell (WSL Birmensdorf)

<p>As usual, we are also planning a <b>meeting of the working group</b> which is a bit different from "regular" GfOe meetings and is going to be a joined event as well. We invite you to get in touch, socialize, have a chat, and get some drinks and snacks. After this socializing event at the conference's venue, we would like to continue this at a pub in Ghent! This will take place on **Tuesday, 12<sup>th</sup> December 2017, 7 p.m.**. For details please have a look at the final conference schedule.

We are looking forward to see you there, please save the dates!
